# Assumptions

The Coal Confidence Index (CCI) is based on the following assumptions:

1. Coal seams exhibit consistently low gamma ray responses relative to surrounding lithologies.

2. Coal typically displays lower bulk density than clastic sediments within the same stratigraphic interval.

3. Coal seams tend to produce stable log responses over short depth windows.

4. Borehole washout degrades log reliability and should reduce coal confidence rather than inflate it.

5. Depth sampling is sufficiently dense to resolve seam thickness above the minimum reporting threshold.

6. Input LAS files have been pre-processed to remove severe acquisition artifacts (e.g., tool failures, major depth mismatches).

These assumptions are applicable to many coal exploration settings but may not hold across all geological environments.
