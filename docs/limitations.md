# Limitations

This project is intentionally deterministic and geology-driven.
As a result, several limitations should be acknowledged:

- The method does not perform lithology classification and should not be considered a substitute for comprehensive petrophysical analysis.

- Coal seams thinner than the minimum thickness threshold may not be detected.

- Highly radioactive coals or carbonaceous shales can reduce gamma ray contrast and lower CCI values.

- Density logs affected by severe borehole conditions may introduce uncertainty, even after normalization.

- The algorithm does not incorporate stratigraphic context, structural complexity, or lateral continuity.

- Results should always be reviewed by a qualified interpreter.

This tool is intended to support interpretation, not replace professional geological judgment.
